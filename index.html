    <p id="apresentacao1">Hello! My name is Pedro, I'm 17 years old and I've always been very interested in the field of technology.<br>
    Ever since I was a kid, I've been passionate about games, and about three years ago, I decided that I wanted to work with something I truly Love.<br>
    <br>
    I'm currently finishing my final year of the <strong>technical high school program in Digital Game Programming</strong> at <strong>the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Barueri(ITB)</strong>.<br>
    My goal is to enter a major technology university here in Brazil that offers a strong program focused on this area that inspires me so much.</p>
    
    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p id="projetos">Currently, I have only one completed project, which is this website to showcase my work.<br>
    However, I have many plans for future projects and have been continuously studying to expand my knowledge<br>
    <br></p>
    <h3 id="projeto1Gaia">Gaia Reset</h3>

        <p>Gaia Reset is a project focused on raising awareness<br> 
        about the consequences of environmental neglect.<br>
        It presents realistic themes in a dystopian setting,<br>
        where most of humanity has taken refuge in space,<br>
        leaving only a few survivors in a designated<br>
        environmental reserve.<br>
        <br>
        You take on the role of Vladislav, one of the<br>
        survivors, whose main goal is to help others<br>
        in the reserve with their problems and, if<br>
        possible, find a solution to their situation.<br>
        <br>
        This game was developed over a year and a half<br>
        and underwent numerous changes and challenges along<br>
        the way. Nevertheless, my team and I managed to<br>
        complete the project in a way that I consider<br>
        satisfactory.</p>
